# Fibonacci Series Generator

This project provides a Python script to generate the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms. The script uses a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers and includes input validation to ensure proper usage.

## Features
- Recursively calculates Fibonacci numbers.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., negative numbers or non-integer values).
- Displays the Fibonacci series in a clean, space-separated format.

3. Enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci series when prompted.
4. View the series printed in the terminal.

## Example
**Input**:  
```
Enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci series: 5
```

**Output**:  
```
Fibonacci series:
0 1 1 2 3
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
